This repository contains:

- a [PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot) of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Atazanavir-Model/releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases).**

This atazanavir model is intended to be used as perpetrator drug in UGT1A1-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI). 

This  whole-body atazanavir PBPK model comprises metabolism by CYP3A4, glomerular filtration and mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4 (this inhibition has not been evaluated and is hence to be regarded preliminary; further work is needed before this model can be applied to predict CYP3A4 DDIs). The atazanavir PBPK model has been developed and evaluated based on clinical data obtained from the scientific literature for oral administration of single or multiple doses ranging from 200 - 800 mg.
