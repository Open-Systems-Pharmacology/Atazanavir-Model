The  final atazanavir PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, glomerular filtration and mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4. While the latter process has not been evaluated using another victim compound, it should only be regarded preliminary and further work is needed before this model can be applied to predict CYP3A4 DDIs. Overall, the model adequately describes the oral pharmacokinetics of  atazanavir in healthy adults receiving approved atazanavir doses of 300 mg and 400 mg. It is therefore deemed fit for purpose to be applied for the investigation of DDIs involving UGT1A1 inhibition.
