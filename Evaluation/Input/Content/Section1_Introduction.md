The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for atazanavir in healthy adults.

Atazanavir, sold under the trade name Reyataz among others, is an azapeptide protease inhibitor and used as antiretroviral medication to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally once a day at a dose of 300 mg, if co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg orally once a day, and 400 mg, if administered without ritonavir. 

After oral administration, atazanavir is rapidly absorbed. A positive food effect has been observed, atazanavir is recommended to be taken with food. Protein binding is relatively high (86%) and independent of the concentration of serum proteins ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References)). Atazanavir undergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A isoenzymes with a dose fraction excreted unchanged in urine of approximately 7% ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References), [Le Tiec 2005](#5-References)). Previous in vitro studies suggest that atazanavir is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References), [Perloff 2005](#5-References)).
