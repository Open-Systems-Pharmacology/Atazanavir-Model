### 2.3.1 Dissolution and absorption

No PK data were available following intravenous administration of atazanavir allowing informing distribution and systemic clearance independently of dissolution and absorption. Consequently, only PK data following oral administration of atazanavir as capsule were used for model building. It was assumed that solubility is not a critical parameter for dissolution of atazanavir capsules in the GI tract; in the models, solubility was therefore fixed to a very high value (50 mg/mL) to prevent solubility being a limiting factor of dissolution. Although the equilibrium solubility of atazanavir in the biorelevant media FaSSIF and FeSSIF has been observed to be rather low (2.74 µg/mL and 4.13 µg/mL in FaSSIF and FeSSIF, respectively), dissolution of atazanavir capsules in these media yields concentrations that are considerably higher than this threshold during the complete measurement period of at least 3 h ([Berlin 2015](#5-References)). In the model, dissolution was described by a Weibull function and the two Weibull parameters, `dissolution shape` and `dissolution time (50% dissolved)`, were fitted together with the `specific intestinal permeability (transcellular)` to observed PK data as described in [Section 2.1](#21-Modeling-Strategy).  

Since no PK data following IV administration was available, a moderate correlation was observed between the fitted `dissolution time (50% dissolved)` and `GFR fraction`. Although the final model parameterization was found to slightly overestimate C<sub>max</sub> in fasted state, this was considered inconsequential since atazanavir must be taken with food and all further model applications encompassed fed state PK.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

With a fraction unbound in human plasma of approximately 0.14, atazanavir is extensively protein-bound. Equilibrium dialysis of spiked human serum or human blood samples *in vitro* showed that atazanavir is bound to serum proteins (86.5%), albumin (86.2%), α1-acid glycoprotein (88.7%), and red blood cells (29.5%). The extent of protein binding and blood cell distribution has been reported to be concentration-independent over a 100-fold range ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References)). The observed PK data were found to be best described using the model for estimating intracellular-to-plasma partition coefficients by Rodgers et al. ([Rodgers 2005](#5-References), [Rodgers 2006](#5-References)) and the cellular permeability automatically calculated by PK-Sim® ([Open Systems Pharmacology Documentation](#5-References)). 

### 2.3.3 Elimination

Atazanavir is extensively metabolized via CYP3A isoenzymes ([Le Tiec 2005](#5-References)). Metabolism was modeled as linear process mediated by CYP3A4 (`in vitro clearance - first order`). The gene expression profile of CYP3A4 was loaded from the internal PK-Sim® database using the expression data quantified by RT-PCR ([Open Systems Pharmacology Documentation](#5-References)). 

Following oral administration of 400 mg [<sup>14</sup>C]atazanavir to healthy males, approximately 7% of the radioactive dose were recovered as unchanged drug in the urine ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References)). Renal excretion of the unchanged drug was modeled as glomerular filtration process. The `GFR fraction` was then, together with the specific clearance via CYP3A4 normalized to the enzyme concentration (`CLspec/[Enzyme]`), fitted to observed PK data as described in [Section 2.1](#21-Modeling-Strategy).

### 2.3.2 Autoinhibition

Findings from in vitro studies indicate that atazanavir irreversibly inhibits CYP3A ([US Food and Drug Administration 2002](#5-References), [Perloff 2005](#5-References)). Since no kinetic values were reported for this mechanism-based inhibition, relevant parameters in the model (`k_kinact_half` and `k_inact`) were fitted as described in [Section 2.1](#21-Modeling-Strategy). An attempt to fix `k_kinact_half` to a very high value (100 µmol/L) to ensure linear inhibition kinetics while fitting `k_inact` and the `GFR faction` resulted in a slightly worse description of the observed PK in the terminal phase. Hence, both `k_kinact_half` and `k_inact were` fitted together with the `GFR fraction`. This resulted in a strong correlation between the former two parameters, but also in a reduction of the total error. Furthermore, the introduction of irreversible CYP3A4 inhibition led to a slightly worse description of clearance of the single dose PK data. Furthermore, the model was found to describe the lowest and highest dose (200 and 800 mg) less accurately. Importantly, though, the PK after multiple dose administration of 300 mg and 400 mg - the only two approved doses - could be adequately captured. 

Of note, since neither *in vitro* data on the mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A nor *in vivo* pharmacokinetic data on drug-drug-interactions (DDI) with a CYP3A index substrate and atazanavir as CYP3A-perpetrator were available, the model should **not** be used to predict CYP3A DDI studies unless it has been verified for this purpose.
